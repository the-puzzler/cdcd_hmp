# Continuous Diffusion on Catagorical Data
My implementatino of Deep Mind's paper applied to an OTU (bacterial) dataset.
 
There are slight differences in implementation. Given the set based nature of OTUs, there is no ROPE use as in the original paper. There is no positional encoding at all. There may be some simplifications in certain places.

## TODO
- Find optimal hyperparameters
- Hyper parameter search
